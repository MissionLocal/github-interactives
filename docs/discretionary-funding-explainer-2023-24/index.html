                        The total city budget for 2023-24 comes to an record-breaking, eye-watering high of $14.6 billion. That's enough money to fill roughly 1,380 Olympic swimming pools with Anchor Steam.
                        <br><br>
                        The Mayor's Office has the greatest responsibility for setting this budget - but a lot of spending is still out of its hands.
                    </p>
                </div>
            
                <div class="step" data-step="1" id="step1" data-img="url('https://missionloca.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/budgetExplainer_2.svg')">
                    <p class="articleInner">
                        Roughly 53 percent of the budget - some $7.8 billion - is allocated to so-called "enterprise departments." These are city departments that largely raise and spend their own funding, meaning they are mostly outside the Mayor's remit.
                        <br><br>
                        Examples include the Municipal Transportation Agency and the airport.

                    <p class="articleInner">
                        That leaves $6.8 billion in the "General Fund," which pays for the remaining departments. But there are still limitations on how this fund can be spent.
                    </p>
                </div>
        
                <div class="step" data-step="3" id="step3" data-img="url('https://missionloca.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/budgetExplainer_4.svg')">
                    <p class="articleInner">
                        Roughly $2.3 billion goes toward what are called "non-discretionary revenues." These include federal and state funds that need to be spent on certain things - such as the public assistance program CalWORKs and CalFresh food stamps.
                    </p>

                    <p class="articleInner">
                        That leaves the Mayor's Office with $4.5 billion "aggregate discretionary revenue" to play with. This money is largely raised via taxes. But even this money cannot be spent however elected officials like.
                    </p>

                    <p class="articleInner">
                        Some $2.1 billion of the discretionary revenue has been allocated to various city departments through voter mandates.
                        <br><br>
                        The library is required to receive around $182 million, the Municipal Transportation Agency must receive $581 million, Children's Services has to receive $620 million, and so on. The Mayor's Office can - and often does - choose to top up these mandated payments. 
                    </p>
                </div>

                <div class="step" data-step="6" id="step6" data-img="url('https://missionloca.s3.amazonaws.com/mission/wp-content/uploads/2023/07/budgetExplainer_7.svg')">
                    <p class="articleInner">
                        That leaves around $2.4 billion in the pot - or about 227 Olympic swimming pools of Anchor Steam.
                        <br><br>
                        That is still a huge amount of money, although it should be noted that lots of the spending here is "baked in" to expenses that are very hard to lower, such as salaries.

                        Finally, the Board of Supervisors has some ability to shuffle around funds after the mayor has proposed her budget.
                        <br><br>
                        This year they have reallocated some $42 million for 2023-24 and $33 million for 2024-25, mainly restoring or expanding social programs for underserved communities.
